      <h2>Why Youth Mental Health is an Issue</h2>
      <p>Mental health among young pupils is increasingly recognised as a major yet ongoing issue. In Wales, research shows that stress, anxiety, and feelings of being alone have been  rising among primary and secondary school children especially after school closures during the Covid-19 pandemic. Surveys indicate that pupils are less physically active, spend less time socialising, and report higher levels of stress and worry when around peers. Near-peer coaching which is where older students coach younger pupils which this helps provide emotional and social support. These programmes help pupils build resilience, improve confidence, and feel more connected to their school community. By including wellbeing activities in the school day, such as peer coaching, discussion groups, and mindfulness exercises which this not only supports mental health but also encourages better learning, improved behaviour, and stronger friendships. </p>
      <p>(These methods support SDG3: Good Health and Wellbeing, promoting positive mental and emotional health at both national and local levels.)</p>

      <h2>How the Issue is Increasing</h2>
      <p>Mental health challenges among children and young people have been rising steadily over the past decade. Data from school surveys shows declines in wellbeing, reduced social interaction, and lower levels of physical activity, while reports of anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem continue to grow. During the Covid-19 pandemic, school closures and disruptions to routine significantly worsened these trends. Evidence also shows that pupils who do not receive early support are more likely to develop longer-term mental health difficulties. Structured programmes such as peer mentoring help children and young people improve emotional regulation, communication, and social skills. Some evaluations suggest that pupils involved in peer-led interventions experience up to 25% improvement in confidence and coping abilities. These findings emphasise the need for carefully planned, school-based programmes to prevent problems from escalating.</p>

    <section id="experiences" class="fade-in">
      <h2>Young People’s Experiences with Mental Health Support</h2>
      <p>While schools provide access to counsellors and other professional mental health services, many pupils feel uncomfortable using these services. Factors such as age gaps, embarrassment, and lack of awareness prevent young people from seeking help. Peer mentoring offers a supportive alternative, where older pupils act as approachable role models, providing guidance, encouragement, and emotional support. This approach builds trust and confidence among younger students, helping them feel safe to share their thoughts and feelings. Peer-led initiatives also make mental health support more accessible, reduce stigma, and create a culture of understanding and empathy within schools.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="improvements" class="fade-in">
      <h2>Suggested Improvements to Mental Health Services</h2>
      <p>Experts recommend integrating mental health and wellbeing into every part of school life. This includes leadership decisions, teaching curriculum, staff training, and active pupil participation. Programmes like the Peer Education Project demonstrate that peer-led support can significantly improve pupils’ mental health knowledge, emotional resilience, and social responsibility. Combining professional support, structured peer interventions, and curriculum-based wellbeing activities creates a sustainable and preventative approach to mental health. Schools that implement these methods are better equipped to help pupils manage stress, improve relationships, and maintain a positive school experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="alternatives" class="fade-in">
      <h2>Alternative Opinions</h2>
      <p>Some researchers and professionals caution that peer-led programmes should not replace trained mental health specialists. Severe cases still require professional assessment and treatment. Peer support should be viewed as a first layer of guidance, offering accessible and relatable support that complements formal services. When implemented properly, peer programmes reduce stigma, make mental health care more approachable, and provide pupils with trusted role models who encourage healthy coping strategies.</p>
